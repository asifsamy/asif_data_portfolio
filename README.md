## Data Analytics

As a data analyst with a background in Software Development, I can bring a unique perspective to the data-driven projects. My skills in Python, SQL, and Spreadsheets combined with my experience in software development, allow me to not only analyze and interpret data but also collect, store, process, and transform data into a format that supports data-driven applications and analysis. I am passionate about using data to drive business decisions and am constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow in this area.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some academic projects 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently Persuing a Data Analytics bootcamp @ Masterschool 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the data industries 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Data Anlysis

## List of Projects

### [Project: Video Games Sales Data (1980-2010) Analysis in Tableau](https://github.com/asifsamy/video_games-sales-1980-2010--analysis)

The dataset on video game sales from 1980 to 2010 will let us take a tour through gaming history! Some questions would be solved in order to perform the analysis and those include: what is the most sold video game, or which gaming genre was the most popular in the early 2000's? Moreover, we could even filter for our old favorite video game to see how many other people enjoyed it! At the end, we would have a story with some dashboards in Tableua for this data analysis.

### [Project: KPI-Dashboard-of-Call_Center_Data_2022](https://github.com/asifsamy/KPI-Dashboard-of-Call_Center_Data_2022)

In this project a dataset of a Call Center has been analyzed using Tableau public. The dataset holds 14 fields but only 7 of them have been used to perform the analyses. There are extra 3 computed fields were created to accompany the analyses. The analysis brought up some KPI cards and their complementary viualizations and lastly, a KPI Dashboard using Tableau containers.

### [Project: Student Performance Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/smasifalsamy/students-perfomance-analysis)

The entire data has been analyzed using Python with its necessary libraries. By analyzing this data I have done some visualizations with performing descriptive statistics. The analyses include a portion of male, and female students and their statistical distribution and visualization of math scores. The category of completeness of test preparation has also been filtered in the dataset to see the performance of overall male and female students.

### [Project: Climate Change (a time-series) Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/smasifalsamy/climate-change-time-series)

Many kinds of data are organized as time-series, and visualizations of time-series are an excellent tool to detect patterns in the data. In this project, a dataset, that contains records of the change in climate in the last half a century or so, has been analyzed. The column "co2" contains measurements of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the column "relative-underscore-temp" denotes the temperature measured at this date, relative to a baseline which is the average temperature in the first ten years of measurements. This time series data has been plotted based on different variables and also an annotation has been used in this dataset.

### [Project: Quantitative comparisons and statistical visualizations](https://www.kaggle.com/code/smasifalsamy/quantitative-comparison)

This project was done using Python with its necessary library. The main idea of this project was to show different types of plots (ideally pyplot from matplotlib) in terms of visualizations. As a result, 3 different datasets were used to accompany the analyses.

### [Project: Deforestation Exploration using SQL](https://github.com/asifsamy/deforestation-sql)

ForestQuery, is a non-profit organization, on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and raises awareness about this important environmental topic.</br>
Our executive director and her leadership team members are looking to understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area. The hope is that these findings can help inform initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to achieve the largest impact with the precious few resources that the organization has at its disposal.</br>
I have been able to find tables of data online dealing with forestation as well as total land area and region groupings, and Iâ€™ve brought these tables together into a database that I would like to query to answer some of the most important questions in preparation for a meeting with the ForestQuery executive team coming up in a few days. Ahead of the meeting, I would like to prepare and disseminate a report for the leadership team that uses complete sentences to help them understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016.

### [Project: Hypothesis Testing](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1hTG5INKJLjl1FeMRjvCpHjzFVxxUw1zu)

A university cafe aims to sell 6 cookies per day on average to meet their quota. The manager is worried and decides to collect data on the daily cookie sales for 10 weeks of the year to predict whether the cafe will manage to meet its average daily quota for the whole year. If they are predicted to sell less than their quota, they will need to reduce cookie production to save costs.

### [Project: Financial Analytics in Spreadsheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1aftFsgw8yVhoFgCKV1X16CZr7KUkvtHf)

Monitoring the evolution of traded assets is key in finance. In this project, a graphical dashboard with spreadsheets has been built to track the performance of financial securities. A focus was established on the historical prices and dividends of the hypothetical stock ABC. </br>
Overall, a visualization of prices, measurement of essential reward and risk indicators, and monitoring if the investment in ABC outperformed a benchmark index or not, etc have been performed in this project. Lastly, in this project, spreadsheets were used to build great monitoring tools used by traders and financial analysts in their day-to-day business life.
